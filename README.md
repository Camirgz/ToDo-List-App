# To-Do List App

This To-Do List App allows users to add tasks and mark them as completed. It features a simple and clean interface designed using HTML and styled with CSS. The functionality is implemented using JavaScript, and it includes local storage to persist tasks even after the browser is closed.

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can input tasks into the text field and click the "Add" button to add them to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed: Users can click on a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a strikethrough effect.
- Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking on the delete icon (âœ—) next to each task.
- Local storage: Tasks are stored locally in the browser's localStorage, allowing them to persist even after the browser is closed.
